Structure-sum
========================================

This is a script to summarize the results from several structure runs. Works for outputs of Structure 2.2 using the admixture, no admixture, correlated and uncorrelated allele frequency models. It works for datasets containing recessive alleles (e.g. AFLP) and for datasets including information about populations of origin (but not for results from the USEPOPINFO option). It does not work for the linkage model.
